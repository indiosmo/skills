# Browser

### browser-use

https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use

browser-use is a Python library designed as a full agent framework — you instantiate an Agent with a task and LLM, and it autonomously completes multi-step browser workflows. It's more of an end-to-end automation solution.

*Use Case*: "Build an autonomous browser agent that fills out job applications"  

### agent-browser

https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser

agent-browser is a CLI tool that provides individual browser commands. It's designed to be called by AI agents (like Claude Code, Cursor) rather than being an agent itself. The AI decides what commands to run.

*Use Case*: "Give Claude/GPT tools to interact with browsers step-by-step"
