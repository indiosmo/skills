# C++ Design Principles

A guide to shaping modern C++ components around clear ownership, explicit
contracts, and local reasoning. The suite [`overview.md`](../overview.md)
defines the suite-wide themes and conventions; this guide applies them to
design.

## C++ standard

The guide assumes C++26. The table below lists fallbacks for the
features used in examples; a blank cell means the feature is already
available in that standard. Rows that read "no clean fallback" call out
patterns that simply do not translate.

| Feature                                      | C++23 fallback                                       | C++20 fallback                                                  |

| `std::stacktrace`                            |                                                      | header-only `cpptrace` or `boost::stacktrace`                   |
| `std::print` / `std::println`                |                                                      | `fmt::print` / `std::format` + `std::fputs`                     |
| `std::function_ref<R(Args...)>`              | header-only `tl::function_ref`                       | header-only `tl::function_ref`                                  |
| Contracts (`pre`, `post`, `contract_assert`) | `MY_ASSERT` / explicit `if`-and-return at entry/exit | `MY_ASSERT` / explicit `if`-and-return at entry/exit            |

| `std::flat_map` / `std::flat_set`            |                                                      | `boost::container::flat_map` / `flat_set`                       |

## The `lib::` namespace

The suite [`overview.md`](../overview.md) introduces the `lib::` placeholder
namespace used across the suite. This guide uses two design-specific helpers
often:

- `lib::strong_type<T, Tag>` is a strong type wrapper around a primitive,
  so two aliases over the same underlying type stay distinct. The `Tag`
  parameter is a phantom type used only for identity. Implementations
  exist in `boost::strong_typedef`, `NamedType`, and similar libraries.
- `lib::fixed_string<N>` is a non-allocating, fixed-capacity string with a
  compile-time maximum length -- the string analogue of
  `boost::container::static_vector`. `boost::static_string<N>` and the
  in-development `std::inplace_string<N>` proposal cover the same shape.
